📍 Project OverView

This project uses MediaPipe to analyze real-time video data from a webcam, detect face and hand landmarks, and compute a confidence score based on facial expressions, head movement, lip motion, and hand gestures. The final confidence score is displayed on the screen, combining data from face and hand analysis.

 ✨ Features

    Face Landmark Detection: Detects key facial landmarks such as eyes, mouth, and head orientation.
    Hand Landmark Detection: Tracks the movements of hands and calculates the confidence based on gesture fluidity.
    Real-Time Feedback: Displays a confidence percentage in real-time based on the user's facial and hand movements.
    Dynamic Updates: Updates the confidence score frame by frame using webcam input.

    Real-Time Face and Hand Detection

    Face and hand landmarks overlaid on a live video stream.

    Confidence Calculation

    Confidence score displayed in real-time, influenced by facial expressions and hand gestures.

    Hand Gestures Tracking

    Shows hand gesture detection and movement calculation.

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.
Prerequisites

    A computer with a working webcam
    A web browser that supports JavaScript and MediaPipe
    Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Installation Steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/MorolShohan/Confidence-Detection-Using-Mediapipe-Facemash.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd confidence-detection

Open the HTML file
Simply open confidence detection.html in your preferred browser:

  

📐 Project Structure

bash

├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── style.css         # Basic styling for the interface
├── README.md         # Project documentation

📊 How it Works
1. Face and Hand Detection

    FaceMesh API from MediaPipe detects and tracks facial landmarks (like eyes, mouth, and nose).
    Hands API from MediaPipe tracks hand gestures and positions.

2. Confidence Calculation

    Smile Detection: Calculates confidence based on the width/height ratio of the mouth.
    Blink Detection: Tracks blink frequency and adjusts confidence accordingly.
    Lip Movement: Monitors lip movement for speaking or lip syncing.
    Hand Gesture Movement: Measures hand movement speed and smoothness.

3. Final Confidence Score

    Combines data from face and hand analysis.
    Displays the confidence score in real-time, allowing dynamic feedback based on movements.

📦 Future Enhancements

    Add support for detecting multiple faces.
    Improve gesture recognition for more complex hand movements.
    Introduce additional facial features like eyebrow movement analysis.
    Enhance visualization with more detailed overlays and confidence breakdown.
